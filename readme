# ðŸ¥¦ NutritionApp

A minimalistic, terminal-based nutrition tracker written in Python.  
Track your daily macros, log realistic food servings, and get suggestions for what to eat next â€” all without needing a fancy UI.

- âœ… Automatically scale macros based on quantity
- âœ… Save your eating history to a JSON file
