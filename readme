#  NutritionApp

A minimalistic, terminal-based nutrition tracker written in Python.  
Track your daily macros, log realistic food servings, and get suggestions for what to eat next — all without needing a fancy UI.

---

## Features

-  Set and track daily macro goals (protein, carbs, fats)
-  Add foods with realistic quantities (e.g. 150g chicken breast, 2 eggs)
-  Automatically scale macros based on quantity
-  Save your eating history to a JSON file
-  Suggest foods you can still eat without exceeding your macros
-  Fuzzy food name matching (no need to type exact names)

---

## Files

- `main.py` – Entry point, runs the tracker
- `tracker.py` – Core logic for adding food, suggestions, saving/loading
- `food.py` – `Food` class definition (holds macros per base quantity)
- `eaten_foods.json` – Persistent daily log of consumed foods
